                                Getting Started
    I chose Blackjack based off my father's love for the game.
Fun fact my father and grandfather once won upwards of 7,000 dollars playing Blackjack over a weekend.
                                  Instructions
        The goal of the game is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as you can without going over.  To play simply press hit to get a new card.  When you are satisfied with your cards press stand to see what the dealer has.

                                    Next Steps
              I would like to incorporate a betting feature, as well as a
                message that displays the value of the cards in your hand.
